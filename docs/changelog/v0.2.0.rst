Version 0.2.0
-------------

First "real" release, including additional tests and finally some PR
contributions :) (Thanks James!)


Features
^^^^^^^^

* Split install requirements into 3 files, which can be read either by ``pip``
  or by the ``setup.py`` script.

  * ``requirements.txt`` is the usual file you install from
  * ``test-requirements.txt`` is a file intended for use when you are testing
    this repo.
  * ``dev-requirements.txt`` is the file you should install from if you are
    hacking in this repo.

* Added a custom ``Clusto-Mode`` header to change how the JSON data is
  presented back:

  * ``compact`` mode: is the default for API calls that return a list of items
    back to the requestor.
  * ``expanded`` mode: is the default for API calls that return a single item
    back to the requestor

* Added a ``by-names`` endpoint, it receives a list of parameters and will
  return back a list of items found
