Version 0.3.0 (2015-02-13)
--------------------------

Feature release


Features
^^^^^^^^

* The ``/by-attr`` endpoint, which translates to the main clusto query method
  ``get_by_attr()``

* Pagination implementation for results. By default it is turned off, basically
  only useful for those cases where your data is still too much. One important
  caveat here is that this only affects the **presentation** of the data back
  to the client, not the **querying** of the data from the database. Pagination
  is not native to clusto, yet

* Minify implementation for results. All results by default are *pretty
  printed* but if you pass a request header they will be printed as a single
  string
